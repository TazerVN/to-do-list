# to-do-list

a fully working to-do list on your browser! Not as unique of a project but I still learn a lot from this.

This project was built to demonstrate:
- ES6 modules and class constructor to create object and element dynamically.
- use JSON to store and retrieve data (from the local storage)
- Interactive element and DOM manipulation using Javascript
- Using bundler (Webpack) to help combine all of the individual files and optimise the output website.
- Utilise some of the Object Oriented Programing SOLID principles to write cleaner code (or at least I tried).
- Realise I should use Typescript instead (half of wasted times spending on figuring out the type)

Important Notes:
- Not recommended to use this seriously as the data is currently saved on your local browser storage, meaning it is not transferable and saved if you switch to another browser. You have been warned! :D
- the checkbox design was borrowed online (it was free yes)
- some of the included images were removed last minute. (from google)
- do not steal my logo! I will be sad.

Unimportant Note:

I have (come) learnt a lot in the past 2 months. Although it was not easy, I enjoyed my time creating this website and applying new knowledge in the process. My initial goal was to learn and participate in enough project to get me into University or get a job. However, I really enjoy learning coding so much that it kinda consumes my whole life. I finally feel like my time was well-spent and I am motivated to continue doing this as long as I can. 

To those who unsure about their future, trying something new might definitely help. That is all. See yall again some day! - Tuan 28/12/2024.
